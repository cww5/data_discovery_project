# Data Discovery Project

## Visualization for Data Discovery in Open Data Portals (Discovery)

Currently existing data portals (as examples): NYC open data, Boston open data, data.gov

The above data portals have a large abundance of data, but are not very accessible; there is little support for discovering links across data sets. As an example of this, there may be 100 data sets about education, and 50 of them may be about students, but we don't know if the set of students is the same or different across the data sets. What if a data consumer is interested in race and gender attribute? These might exist across health, education, and crime data sets. Unless they download all the files and manually check for an overlap, the consumer can't find these patterns.

## Goal

Help users visually understand these links and also understand what information can be gained by such links (e.g., linking data sets A, D, and C might provide less information than linking datasets G, D, and F). So, visualization can be used to suggest interesting patterns otherwise difficult to detect.
